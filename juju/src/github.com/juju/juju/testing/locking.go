// Use this as a building block in your own tests for proper locking.
// Parameters are a lock that you expect your function to block on, and
// the function that you want to test for proper locking on that lock.
//
// This helper attempts to verify that the function both obtains and releases
// the lock.  It will panic if the function fails to do either.
// TODO: Support generic sync.Locker instead of just Mutex.
// TODO: This could be a gocheck checker.
// TODO(rog): make this work reliably even for functions that take longer
