## Cloud Native Deployments of Cassandra using Kubernetes

The following document describes the development of a _cloud native_
[Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) deployment on Kubernetes.  When we say
_cloud native_, we mean an application which understands that it is running
within a cluster manager, and uses this cluster management infrastructure to
help implement the application.  In particular, in this instance, a custom
Cassandra `SeedProvider` is used to enable Cassandra to dynamically discover
new Cassandra nodes as they join the cluster.

This example also uses some of the core components of Kubernetes:

- [_Pods_](../../docs/user-guide/pods.md)
- [ _Services_](../../docs/user-guide/services.md)
- [_Replication Controllers_](../../docs/user-guide/replication-controller.md).

### Prerequisites

This example assumes that you have a Kubernetes cluster installed and running,
and that you have installed the [`kubectl`](../../docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl.md)
command line tool somewhere in your path.  Please see the
[getting started guides](../../docs/getting-started-guides/)
for installation instructions for your platform.

This example also has a few code and configuration files needed.  To avoid
typing these out, you can `git clone` the Kubernetes repository to you local
computer.

### A note for the impatient

This is a somewhat long tutorial.  If you want to jump straight to the "do it
now" commands, please see the [tl; dr](#tl-dr) at the end.

### Simple Single Pod Cassandra Node

In Kubernetes, the atomic unit of an application is a
[_Pod_](../../docs/user-guide/pods.md).
A Pod is one or more containers that _must_ be scheduled onto
the same host.  All containers in a pod share a network namespace, and may
optionally share mounted volumes.

In this simple case, we define a single container running Cassandra for our pod:

<!-- BEGIN MUNGE: EXAMPLE cassandra.yaml -->

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cassandra
  name: cassandra
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - /run.sh
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "0.1"
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/cassandra:v8
    name: cassandra
    ports:
    - name: cql
      containerPort: 9042
    - name: thrift
      containerPort: 9160
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data
      mountPath: /cassandra_data
    env:
    - name: MAX_HEAP_SIZE
      value: 512M
    - name: HEAP_NEWSIZE
      value: 100M
    - name: POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  volumes:
    - name: data
      emptyDir: {}
```

[Download example](cassandra.yaml?raw=true)
<!-- END MUNGE: EXAMPLE cassandra.yaml -->

There are a few things to note in this description.  First is that we are
running the [```gcr.io/google-samples/cassandra:v8```](image/Dockerfile)
image from Google's [container registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/).

This is a standard Cassandra installation on top of Debian.  However it also
adds a custom
[`SeedProvider`](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cassandra/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/locator/SeedProvider.java) to Cassandra.  In
Cassandra, a ```SeedProvider``` bootstraps the gossip protocol that Cassandra
uses to find other nodes.
The [`KubernetesSeedProvider`](java/src/io/k8s/cassandra/KubernetesSeedProvider.java)
discovers the Kubernetes API Server using the built in Kubernetes
discovery service, and then uses the Kubernetes API to find new nodes (more on
this later). See the [image](image/) directory of this example for specifics on
how the container image was built and what it contains.

You may also note that we are setting some Cassandra parameters (`MAX_HEAP_SIZE`
and `HEAP_NEWSIZE`) and adding information about the
[namespace](../../docs/user-guide/namespaces.md).
We also tell Kubernetes that the container exposes
both the `CQL` and `Thrift` API ports.  Finally, we tell the cluster
manager that we need 0.1 cpu (0.1 core).

In theory, we could create a single Cassandra pod right now, but since
`KubernetesSeedProvider` needs to learn what nodes are in the Cassandra
deployment we need to create a service first.

### Cassandra Service

In Kubernetes, a _[Service](../../docs/user-guide/services.md)_ describes a set
of Pods that perform the same task.  For example, the set of Pods in a Cassandra
cluster can be a Kubernetes Service, or even just the single Pod we created
above.  An important use for a Service is to create a load balancer which
distributes traffic across members of the set of Pods.  But a _Service_ can also
be used as a standing query which makes a dynamically changing set of Pods (or
the single Pod we've already created) available via the Kubernetes API.  This is
the way that we use initially use Services with Cassandra.

Here is the service description:

<!-- BEGIN MUNGE: EXAMPLE cassandra-service.yaml -->

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cassandra
  name: cassandra
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 9042
  selector:
    app: cassandra
```

[Download example](cassandra-service.yaml?raw=true)
<!-- END MUNGE: EXAMPLE cassandra-service.yaml -->

The important thing to note here is the `selector`. It is a query over
labels, that identifies the set of _Pods_ contained by the _Service_.  In this
case the selector is `app=cassandra`.  If you look back at the Pod
specification above, you'll see that the pod has the corresponding label, so it
will be selected for membership in this Service.

Create this service as follows:

```console
$ kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra-service.yaml
```

Now, as the service is running, we can create the first Cassandra pod using the mentioned specification.

```console
$ kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
```

After a few moments, you should be able to see the pod running, plus its single container:

```console
$ kubectl get pods cassandra
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cassandra   1/1       Running   0          55s
```

You can also query the service endpoints to check if the pod has been correctly selected.

```console
$ kubectl get endpoints cassandra -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2015-06-21T22:34:12Z
  labels:
    app: cassandra
  name: cassandra
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "944373"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/endpoints/cassandra
  uid: a3d6c25f-1865-11e5-a34e-42010af01bcc
subsets:
- addresses:
  - ip: 10.244.3.15
    targetRef:
      kind: Pod
      name: cassandra
      namespace: default
      resourceVersion: "944372"
      uid: 9ef9895d-1865-11e5-a34e-42010af01bcc
  ports:
  - port: 9042
    protocol: TCP
```

### Adding replicated nodes

Of course, a single node cluster isn't particularly interesting.  The real power
of Kubernetes and Cassandra lies in easily building a replicated, scalable
Cassandra cluster.

In Kubernetes a
_[Replication Controller](../../docs/user-guide/replication-controller.md)_
is responsible for replicating sets of identical pods.  Like a
_Service_, it has a selector query which identifies the members of its set.
Unlike a _Service_, it also has a desired number of replicas, and it will create
or delete _Pods_ to ensure that the number of _Pods_ matches up with its
desired state.

Replication controllers will "adopt" existing pods that match their selector
query, so let's create a replication controller with a single replica to adopt
our existing Cassandra pod.

<!-- BEGIN MUNGE: EXAMPLE cassandra-controller.yaml -->

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cassandra
  name: cassandra
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
      app: cassandra
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cassandra
    spec:
      containers:
        - command:
            - /run.sh
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 0.1
          env:
            - name: MAX_HEAP_SIZE
              value: 512M
            - name: HEAP_NEWSIZE
              value: 100M
            - name: POD_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          image: gcr.io/google-samples/cassandra:v8
          name: cassandra
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9042
              name: cql
            - containerPort: 9160
              name: thrift
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /cassandra_data
              name: data
      volumes:
        - name: data
          emptyDir: {}
```

[Download example](cassandra-controller.yaml?raw=true)
<!-- END MUNGE: EXAMPLE cassandra-controller.yaml -->

Most of this replication controller definition is identical to the Cassandra pod
definition above; it simply gives the replication controller a recipe to use
when it creates new Cassandra pods.  The other differentiating parts are the
`selector` attribute which contains the controller's selector query, and the
`replicas` attribute which specifies the desired number of replicas, in this
case 1.

Create this controller:

```console
$ kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra-controller.yaml
```

Now this is actually not that interesting, since we haven't actually done
anything new.  Now it will get interesting.

Let's scale our cluster to 2:

```console
$ kubectl scale rc cassandra --replicas=2
```

Now if you list the pods in your cluster, and filter to the label `app=cassandra`, you should see two cassandra pods:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -l="app=cassandra"
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cassandra         1/1       Running   0          3m
cassandra-af6h5   1/1       Running   0          28s
```

Notice that one of the pods has the human-readable name `cassandra` that you
specified in your config before, and one has a random string, since it was named
by the replication controller.

To prove that this all works, you can use the `nodetool` command to examine the
status of the cluster.  To do this, use the `kubectl exec` command to run
`nodetool` in one of your Cassandra pods.

```console
$ kubectl exec -ti cassandra -- nodetool status
Datacenter: datacenter1
=======================
Status=Up/Down
|/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
--  Address     Load       Tokens  Owns (effective)  Host ID                               Rack
UN  10.244.0.5  74.09 KB   256     100.0%            86feda0f-f070-4a5b-bda1-2eeb0ad08b77  rack1

```

Now let's scale our cluster to 4 nodes:

```sh
$ kubectl scale rc cassandra --replicas=4
```

In a few moments, you can examine the status again:

```sh
$ kubectl exec -ti cassandra -- nodetool status
Datacenter: datacenter1
=======================
Status=Up/Down
|/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
--  Address     Load       Tokens  Owns (effective)  Host ID                               Rack

```

### Using a DaemonSet

Before you start this section, __delete the replication controller__ you created above:

```sh
$ kubectl delete rc cassandra
```

In Kubernetes a _[Daemon Set](../../docs/admin/daemons.md)_ can distribute pods
onto Kubernetes nodes, one-to-one.  Like a _ReplicationController_, it has a
selector query which identifies the members of its set.  Unlike a
_ReplicationController_, it has a node selector to limit which nodes are
scheduled with the templated pods, and replicates not based on a set target
number of pods, but rather assigns a single pod to each targeted node.

An example use case: when deploying to the cloud, the expectation is that
instances are ephemeral and might die at any time. Cassandra is built to
replicate data across the cluster to facilitate data redundancy, so that in the
case that an instance dies, the data stored on the instance does not, and the
cluster can react by re-replicating the data to other running nodes.

`DaemonSet` is designed to place a single pod on each node in the Kubernetes
cluster. If you're looking for data redundancy with Cassandra, let's create a
daemonset to start our storage cluster:

<!-- BEGIN MUNGE: EXAMPLE cassandra-daemonset.yaml -->

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    name: cassandra
  name: cassandra
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cassandra
    spec:
      # Filter to specific nodes:
      # nodeSelector:
      #  app: cassandra
      containers:
        - command:
            - /run.sh
          env:
            - name: MAX_HEAP_SIZE
              value: 512M
            - name: HEAP_NEWSIZE
              value: 100M
            - name: POD_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          image: gcr.io/google-samples/cassandra:v8
          name: cassandra
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9042
              name: cql
            - containerPort: 9160
              name: thrift
          resources:
            request:
              cpu: 0.1
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /cassandra_data
              name: data
      volumes:
        - name: data
          emptyDir: {}
```

[Download example](cassandra-daemonset.yaml?raw=true)
<!-- END MUNGE: EXAMPLE cassandra-daemonset.yaml -->

Most of this daemon set definition is identical to the Cassandra pod and
ReplicationController definitions above; it simply gives the daemon set a recipe
to use when it creates new Cassandra pods, and targets all Cassandra nodes in
the cluster.  The other differentiating part from a Replication Controller is
the `nodeSelector` attribute which allows the daemonset to target a specific
subset of nodes, and the lack of a `replicas` attribute due to the 1 to 1 node-
pod relationship.

Create this daemonset:

```console
$ kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra-daemonset.yaml
```

You may need to disable config file validation, like so:

```console
$ kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra-daemonset.yaml --validate=false
```

Now, if you list the pods in your cluster, and filter to the label
`app=cassandra`, you should see one new cassandra pod for each node in your
network.

```console
$ kubectl get pods -l="app=cassandra"
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cassandra-af6h5   1/1       Running   0          28s
cassandra-2jq1b   1/1       Running   0          32s
cassandra-34j2a   1/1       Running   0          29s
```

To prove that this all works, you can use the `nodetool` command to examine the
status of the cluster.  To do this, use the `kubectl exec` command to run
`nodetool` in one of your Cassandra pods.

```console
$ kubectl exec -ti cassandra-af6h5 -- nodetool status
Datacenter: datacenter1
=======================
Status=Up/Down
|/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
--  Address     Load       Tokens  Owns (effective)  Host ID                               Rack
UN  10.244.0.5  74.09 KB   256     100.0%            86feda0f-f070-4a5b-bda1-2eeb0ad08b77  rack1

```

### tl; dr;

For those of you who are impatient, here is the summary of the commands we ran in this tutorial.

```sh
# create a service to track all cassandra nodes
kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra-service.yaml

# create a single cassandra node
kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra.yaml

# create a replication controller to replicate cassandra nodes
kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra-controller.yaml

# scale up to 2 nodes
kubectl scale rc cassandra --replicas=2

# validate the cluster
kubectl exec -ti cassandra -- nodetool status

# scale up to 4 nodes
kubectl scale rc cassandra --replicas=4

# delete the replication controller
kubectl delete rc cassandra

# then create a daemonset to place a cassandra node on each kubernetes node
kubectl create -f examples/cassandra/cassandra-daemonset.yaml
```
